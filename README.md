Basically what this mod does is exactly what the "About" section tells you.

It has some bugs, like fall damage being a bit too high and jumping way too quick upon going up block making it seem as you are almost flying but not. But anyways I'm not sure how to fix either of those issues without my singular brain cell blowing up.
